# We ahead's Portus configuration

[![latest 2.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/latest-2.0.1-green.svg)](https://github.com/weahead/docker-portus-conf/releases/tag/v2.0.1)

Docker image that puts configuration for Portus on a volume at `/usr/local/etc/portus` via [confd](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd).

For use with [Rancher](http://rancher.com/), because configuration files use Rancher's [metadata service](http://docs.rancher.com/rancher/rancher-services/metadata-service/).

Based on [`weahead/conf`](https://github.com/weahead/docker-conf).
